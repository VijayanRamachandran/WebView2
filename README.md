#  WebView2Browser

In 2019 Microsoft announced Win32 preview of WebViewControl powered by the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge. To demonstrate the new WebViewâ€™s capabilities, Microsoft built a sample browser app using the WebView2 APIs. The intent was to develop a rich sample that benefits other developers building on top of WebView2, and to provide direct feedback to the rest of the WebView2 team from first-hand app-building experience. The sample features an array of functionalities, such as navigation, searching from the address bar, tabs, favorites, history, and verifying a secure connection. Below are some of links which provide information about the demonstration.

#  WebView2Browser in WPF

We have done prototype to host the WebView2Control in WPF. Below are the requisites and Steps to run the WPF prototype.

##  Requisites

-   [Microsoft Edge (Chromium) Dev Channel - Latest](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/)  installed on a supported OS.
-   [Visual Studio - 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)  with C++ support installed.
-   [Microsoft.Web.WebView2 - Latest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2) SDK ( Nuget Package )
-   [Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary - Latest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary) SDK ( Nuget Package )

##  Steps To Execute Prototypes

1. After performing all prerequisites, clone all Prototypes from https://github.com/VijayanRamachandran/WebView2.git
2. Execute WPFHostWindow.exe available in respective bin folder.

##  Respository Information

| Folder| Information |
|--|--|
| WebView2Browser-WithoutToolbar-Dll|  C++ DLL which wraps call to WebView2 API's |	
| WebView2BrowserWrapper |  C# Wrapper |	
| WPFHostWindow - Html - Table - Angular | WPF Exe which hosts WebView2 and Renders Angular 9 Material Table |
| WPFHostWindow - Html - Table | WPF Exe which hosts WebView2 and Renders Html Table with Hardcoded Data |
| WPFHostWindow - KeyBoard-Interaction | WPF Exe which hosts some WPF Controls and WebView2 Control to check the TAB Key Interaction ( Focus ) |
| WPFHostWindow - Popup | WPF Exe which hosts Modal WPF Window which renders PDF in WebView2 Control |
| WPFHostWindow - Pdf | WPF Exe which hosts WebView2 and PDF is loaded to WebView2. |
| WPFHostWindow - TwoControls | WPF Exe which hosts Multiple WebView2. |

# Open Issue

##  Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr in C++ Header File:
As of now, In C++ DLL ( WebView2Browser-WithoutToolbar-Dll, [BrowserWindow.h](https://github.com/VijayanRamachandran/WebView2/blob/master/WebView2Browser-WithoutToolbar-Dll/WebView2Browser-Master/BrowserWindow.h) ) we can't have any member variable of type Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<IWebView2Environment> in the header file while we export the class with  __declspec( dllexport ).
  
To overcome this, we made all member variable which requries Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr< >, as global variable in [BrowserWindow.cpp](https://github.com/VijayanRamachandran/WebView2/blob/master/WebView2Browser-WithoutToolbar-Dll/WebView2Browser-Master/BrowserWindow.cpp) and in [Tab.cpp](https://github.com/VijayanRamachandran/WebView2/blob/master/WebView2Browser-WithoutToolbar-Dll/WebView2Browser-Master/Tab.cpp)

With this workaround prototypes are working as expected, but we need a fix for it.

## PS: Release Nuget Package for WebView2
As we don't have release Nuget Package for WebView2 and its dependencies, currently we evaulated the performance of rendering a page in WebView2 with Debug X64 version of our C++, C# Wrapper and WPF Application. Because of this we are observing a drastic performance dropdown in rendering a page ( Refer Page 6 and 7 in [WebView2hosting.pdf](https://github.com/VijayanRamachandran/WebView2/blob/master/Webview2hosting.pdf) )

## If Prototype doesn't Render HTML
If prototypes doesnt render HTML as expected in WPF, It can be due to Nuget Version of Microsoft.Web.WebView2, Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary and Microsoft Edge Chromium.

Request you to install below stable version instead of latest.

Microsoft.Web.WebView2 - V0.8.270

Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary - V1.0.190716.2

Microsoft Edge Chromium - 79.0.309.43
